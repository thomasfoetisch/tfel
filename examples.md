The strength of the TFEL is to provide a DSL close to the language
typically used to express and describe linear partial differential
equations and their solutions. 

This page go through several examples, going form the mathematical
description of continuous problem to it's discretization and
implementation with the help of the TFEL.

We go from the most basic problem as the Poisson equation with
Dirichlet boundary conditions to more advanced problems related to
transport equations and fluid flows.


# Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions

# Transport equation with an SUPG numerical stabilisation method

# Stokes problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions

# Navier-Stokes problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions
