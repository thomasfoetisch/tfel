# Missing features
There are however a number of feature that are (still) missing. Some
of them may already be part of the roadmap. Of course, the list is not
exhaustive.

  * Non-simplicial meshes handling,
  * a set of loader for common mesh and geometry file format (gmsh, Ensight [6|Gold], ...)
  * vector valued finite elements,
  * ...
  
Feel free to send PR if you want to contribute to one of these missing features, or if you have other ideas and suggestions.
