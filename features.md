  * Uniform handling of the dimensionality of the problem,
  * Easy to extend: adding a quadrature formula or adding a finite element is as simple as defining a new class,
  * Domain specific language to describe the functional forms,
  * Built as a toolbox: each componant can be replaced or reused for a different purpose.
  
  
# Missing features
There are however a number of feature that are (still) missing. Some
of them may already be part of the roadmap. Of course, the list is not
exhaustive.

  * Non-simplicial meshes handling,
  * a set of loader for common mesh and geometry file format (gmsh, Ensight 6, Ensight Gold, ...)
  * vector valued finite elements,
  * some basic mesh manipulation facilities: submesh extraction, merging, transformation, and so on, 
  * ...
  
Feel free to send PR if you want to contribute to one of these missing features, or if you have other ideas and suggestions.
