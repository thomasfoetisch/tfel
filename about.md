# About me

I am a physicist, and currently about to obtain a doctor title in
mathematics, in the domain of finite element methods. Beside applied
mathematics and physics, I have some interest in computer sciences,
and more specificly in formal languages, parsing and type
theory. During my PhD studies, I wrote C++ code daily as part of my
research activities, but I also write code as a hobby. I also do some
road cycling, running (3 marathons so far) and trail running. Oh, and
I am currently looking for a job!

# Motivation for the development of the TFEL
The TFEL started as an experiment. I was interested to see how well the
concepts and the mathematical language of finite element methods could
be modelled with the C++ language. I especially wanted to see to which
extent template expression could be leveraged to automate the
construction of assembly routines of the functional forms. The TFEL is
not meant to offer the fastest matrix assembly routines. Instead, the
TFEL offer a framework which allows clear and concise expression of
finite element methods, but still with very reasonable
performances. It is still very much a work in progress, though!
